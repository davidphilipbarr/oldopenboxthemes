You don't have to read me really.

some points of note 'NB' is you will.

there should be some button xbms to suit your needs, as a guide if you include the shadow, then you should use a button that is as many pixels high as your text, this will then be centred. If you get rid of the shadow then a bitmap either +/- 1 pixel will centre. there you go. never say i don't care. 

this is basically the 'clearlooks' theme for metacity, whcih is basically industrial bred with bluecurve, i don;t know who or what has 'ownership' of this particular looks.
