Here are the original folder (and some action) icons for the Tango iconset in a subset that inherits Tango-proper. The folders are quite a lot like Novell folders.

the svgs have had their defs vacuumed.

I think all or 99% of the icons are just package from the tango archives. A few gap fillers may have been knocked up. I haven't really tried them very well so if you spot a blue folder, sorry :)
