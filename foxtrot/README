Ahem.

i have shuffled the icons around like a croupier on speed, i hope they are all in their 'correct' places now.

so stuff original icons by Andreas Nilsson, original bluecurve icons by garrett LeSage.

it's not really complete, by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not getting any more complete either :)

probably all under creative commons license?
