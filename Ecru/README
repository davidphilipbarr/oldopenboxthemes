This theme uses a few chunks of svg and png icons from the gnome icon theme (it is supposed to sit on top of the gnome icon theme, so what do i care?) So it is under the same licence it is like or something.

It uses some tango colours and ideas but it is no slave to tango guidelines, don't expect it to be. 

I wanted to make some icons that were a bit like the old (action) icons from gnome 1.x but would not look out of place with the current icons. (so i did not have to make a complete set)
